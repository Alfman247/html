    <h3>Beginner and Basic Credit Cards</h3>
    <p1>In the world of begginer or basic credit cards, there is no one card which I can reccomend this is
         due to the fact that the best begginer card is the one which you will get accepted for, as being
         declined will damage your credit score even more at the time where it is most fragile. I would
         reccomend using a wesbite such as <a href="https://www.moneysupermarket.com">MoneySuperMarket</a>
         to help you compare and find what you will get accepted for. The same rule applies for basic credit
         cards, accept for the fact that it is probably wise to go with a card with your current bank, as
         this will make your life a bit easier. This goes alongside the fact that basic credit cards offer
         little-to-no rewards.
    </p1>
    <h3>Reward Credit Cards</h3>
    <p1>Reward Credit Cards are where things can get a bit more interesting. You still should complete
         eligibility checks, but you have way more options to compare between for different benefits.
         Most of these cards are free, but some may come with a small £25 annual fee, which in many cases
         is definitely worth it! This market is dominated by <i>American Express</i>, who offer amazing
         benefits with the catch of not being accepted at all stores. Below I have included a table comparing
         both American Express cards and Mastercards/Visas

    <h3>Premium Credit Cards</h3>
    <p1>American Express exclusively runs this market effectively within the UK with two main
         cards, the Gold Card and the Platinum Card, both of which having an annual fee over
         £100. If you have this kind of money to splurge, it may be very much worth it, as these
         can also come with very high credit limits. Here is an image of the <i>Platinum Card</i>
