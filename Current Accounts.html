        <i>Current Accounts</i>
        <h3>Basic Current Accounts</h3>
        <p1>Basic Current Accounts are designed for those who would struggle to get other bank accounts,
             and therefore come with little-to-no benefits. Despite this, you still should not pick an
             account at random! To begin, I would highly reccomend in this scenario that you choose a
             bank with a branch near to you. Alternatively, if you already have an account such as a
             savings account with a bank, I would reccomend going with them. If none of this applies
             to you, I would reccomend basing your choice on a customer satisfaction survey. Here is
             an example below!</p1>

        <h3>Standard Current Accounts</h3>
        <p1>Now, the standard current account market is extremely saturated, as every bank and building
             society will offer you one. These usually have slightly stricter requirements than basic
             accounts, such as a minimun age of 18 instead if 16 and proof of address. Despite these
             the majority of the population of the UK will be able to get their hands on one. Another
             benefit of these accounts is that banks will occasionally offer special bonuses, such as
             nationwide recently offering cashback on a supermarket shop. This catagory also includes
             fintech banks, such as Starling Bank and Monzo, whi typically offer better apps than most
             banks, which may be important. However, due to their nature, these banks have no branches
             therefore meaning deposits must be made at the post office, which may be less convinient
             for you! To choose the correct account for you, I would reccomend looking at any benefits
             the bank will offer you, such as cashback from Chase or a better app from Starling. If
             nothing is standing out to you, I would reccomend following my previous advice and looking
             into nearby bank branches and customer satisfaction surveys. Due to this being my advice,
             I will not be placing another table.

        <h3>Packaged Current Accounts</h3>
        <p1>Packaged Current Accounts can be amazing if you love getting a great deal on insurance! Many
             of these accounts will bundle together different forms of insurance, such as travel, breakdown
             and phone cover. However, this can come at a cost woth some bank accounts having montly fees
             as high as £24 a month! Most of these types of accounts will charge a monthly fee, however, some
             accounts will waive the fee if you have a certain amount in you account. Because these amounts
             are usually incredibly high, these have been bundled with <i>Premium Current Accounts</i>. I've
             included a comparison table below to help provide you with more information!

        <h3>Premium Current Accounts</h3>
        <p1>Premium Current Accounts are amazing - if you can get one! Some of them will offer similar
             benefits above at a reduced price or maybe even with better features. The massive catch is
             the minimum income out of any of these accounts is £75,000. This is also known as <b>a lot</b>.
             If you are lucky enough to get your hands on one of these, you most certainly should as many of
             these banks will even provide you with luxurious benefits such as a concierge. In my personal
             (and completely unprofesional) opinion, I believe the HSBC premier account is the best on the
             market due to it's amazing features for free! They are also a well known bank, making this an
             even better option. With free travel insurance and links to amazing creit cards, this card is a
             must! I have placed a picture of the card below.
